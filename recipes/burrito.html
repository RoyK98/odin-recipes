            <li>Smoked Paprika</li>
            <li>Garlic powder</li>

            <li>1 cup 2% fat cottage cheese</li>
            <li>1 tb low fat cream cheese</li>

        </ul>

    </p>

    <p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

    </p>

    <p>

        <ol>

            <li>Cut your chicken breasts into cubes.</li>
            <li>Season it generously with the smoked paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder.</li>
            <li>Cook the chicken on a pan until it is thoroughly cooked.</li>
            <li>Next we want to focus on the sauce. For the sauce, put in your cottage cheese, low fat cream cheese, and hot sauce into a blender. (You do not need to blend it all together, however, I recommend doing so)</li>
            <li>If you have juice from the chicken, drain it.</li>
            <li>Mix the sauce, chicken, and mozzarella cheese all in a bowl.</li>
            <li>From here, you want to get four tortillas and evenly distribute the chicken onto the tortillas to form a burrito.</li>
            <li>Once you have the burritos made, you can store them in the fridge/freezer with some aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>To preheat, get a hot pan and heat up the burritos. This will give it a nice crunchy burrito.</li>
            <li>Last step is to serve it on a plate and enjoy!</li>

        </ol>
